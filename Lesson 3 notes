Highly motivated and detail-oriented Quality Analyst with an extensive record of delivering robust, reliable Web-based, and client/server applications by developing and executing comprehensive test strategies within fast-paced development environments and industry regulations. 

It is important to me to be involved in interestig projects that push my skill boundaries.  Though I have lived in Las Vegas since 2009, I am an east coast mindset and lived in Florida for over 30 years.

My dream job would allow me to expand my frontend skillsets while performing my QA duties.

While I work I listen to Jazz, and piano concerto music.
